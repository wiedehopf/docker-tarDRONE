# docker-tarDRONE

## Overview

First off, huge thanks to the following devs for their work in this realm:
- Tar1090 Dev: [wiedehopf](https://github.com/wiedehopf)
- DragonOS Dev: [alphafox02](https://github.com/alphafox02) - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cemaxecuter7783)
- Sniffle Dev: [nccgroup](https://github.com/nccgroup)

This project provides a dockerized way to track drones via RemoteID (FAA required on drones over 249 grams). It will keep a cache of drones in the local area that the BLE dongle can receive signals from and map them on tar1090. To accomplish this, it uses the following:

- a modified instance of [tar1090](https://github.com/wiedehopf/tar1090)
- [Sniffle](https://github.com/bkerler/Sniffle/tree/zmq): project for sniffing the BLE packets
- [DroneID](https://github.com/bkerler/DroneID) for decoding the BLE traffic
- [zmqToTar1090](https://github.com/l0g-lab/zmqToTar1090) for converting decoded data into specific JSON format for ingestion into tar1090

## Requirements

- Docker with BuildKit enabled
- BLE5 dongle (I use a Sonoff Zigbee 3.0 with custom firmware from [nccgroup](https://github.com/nccgroup/Sniffle))
- Drone >249 grams or a RemoteID transmitter

## Installation

1. Clone this repo to your local machine: `$ git clone https://github.com/l0g-lab/docker-tarDRONE`
2. Change directory into the project: `$ cd docker-tarDRONE`
3. Modify the `.env` file within the project root directory with:\
    TZ: Your current TimeZone\
    LAT/LONG: The latitude & longitude of your current location or the RemoteID receiver\
    USB_DEVICE: The device of your sniffle receiver dongle (normally `/dev/ttyUSB0` if you have no other devices connected)

## How to use

1. Run the project with: `$ DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker-compose -f docker-compose-tarDRONE.yml up`

    This will take some time while the containers are downloaded and software is built.

2. Once the project is up (you can confirm with `$ docker ps`), you'll need to copy the [receiver.json](https://github.com/l0g-lab/docker-tarDRONE/blob/main/tar1090_mod/receiver.json) file into the `/run/readsb` directory on your local machine. *This will hopefully soon be automated*

    Until this step is automated, you may want to edit the receiver.json file with the LAT/LONG values from the above installation step 3 for accuracy on the map.

3. Open your web browser to: `http://localhost:8078`
